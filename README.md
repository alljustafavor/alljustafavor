# Hi! I'm Joseph

I'm a software engineer in training at BloomTech Institute. I'm currently learning Redux and React.

Some of my favorite projects so far have been the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) ,a frontend mockup version of UberEats and lastly Todo_CRUD.

* **NASA APOD**: was my first time building something with the help of an API. I enjoyed learning how to make HTTP requests and parse JSON data.
* **BloomEats**: was a more challenging project, but it was also more rewarding. I had to use everything I had learned about React to build a functional and realistic mockup.
* **Todo CRUD**: was my first project where I implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. It was a significant learning experience that helped me understand the fundamental operations of any backend service.

I'm still learning, but I'm passionate about software development. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

**Skills**

* Programming languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* Frameworks: React, Redux
* Tools: Git, GitHub
