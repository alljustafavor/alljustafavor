# Hi! I'm Joseph

I'm a software engineer in training at BloomTech Institute. I'm currently Redux and React.

Some of my favorite projects so far have been the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and a mockup version of UberEats.

* **NASA APOD** was my first time building something with the help of an API. I enjoyed learning how to make HTTP requests and parse JSON data.
* **UberEats** was a more challenging project, but it was also more rewarding. I had to use everything I had learned about React to build a functional and realistic mockup.

I'm still learning, but I'm passionate about software development. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

**Skills**

* Programming languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* Frameworks: React
* Tools: Git, GitHub

**Thanks for reading!**
